              Changed code: add a linked image that represents Amina.
              - The image src uses Unsplash's "source" endpoint to return a relevant photo (african, woman, well).
              - The image is wrapped in a link to the Unsplash search page so visitors can view source images.
              - target="_blank" opens the source in a new tab and rel="noopener noreferrer" is a security best-practice.
              - Alt text is descriptive for screen readers.

            <p>
                Amina used to walk miles every day to collect water for her family. Thanks to your support, her village now has a clean water well. Amina can go to school and her family is healthier and happier.
